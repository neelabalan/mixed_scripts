# Mathematical explanation for why the probability of a random real-valued square matrix being singular is almost always zero

> From GPT4

A square matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero. The determinant of a square matrix is a polynomial function of its entries. For a matrix to be singular, its entries must satisfy the polynomial equation $det(A) = 0$

Now, consider the space of all possible matrices of a given size (say, $n \times n$) with real number entries. This space can be thought of as ${\mathbb{R}^{n^2}}$ since each matrix can be represented by $n^2$ real numbers (the entries of the matrix). 
This space is a continuous, infinite space.

The set of matrices that are singular corresponds to the solutions of the polynomial equation $det(A) = 0$. In the context of ${\mathbb{R}^{n^2}}$ ,this equation represents a set of measure zero. In simpler terms, it's like considering the set of points that lie on a specific curve or surface within a much larger space. While there are infinitely many such points, their "volume" or "area" in the space is negligible compared to the entire space.

For example, in a 3D space (like ${\mathbb{R}^3}$), a curve or a line has no volume compared to the whole space. Similarly, in the space of matrices, the set of singular matrices is like a "thin layer" or "curve" within the vast space of all matrices.

Therefore, when you randomly select a matrix from this space (especially when using continuous probability distributions for the entries), the probability of picking a point from this "thin layer" is almost zero. This is why randomly generated real-valued square matrices are almost always non-singular.
